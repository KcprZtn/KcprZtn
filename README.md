Hello, my name is Kacper.
This is my new github account I created after short break from programming so it's quite empty. 

Currently I'm working on getting better at C# and SQL. I am mainly interested in creating web applications using .NET MVC.
Although at this moment I don't have access to most applications I made in the past, you can look at one that I made recently.\
It's hosted on heroku so feel free to check it out: https://pets-mvc.herokuapp.com

KcprZtn/KcprZtn is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
